            <h3>Free To Use</h3>
            <p>
                Our website will always be free to use, and is not limited behind a paywall. We do offer the ability to promote your tribe applications, and items on the Trade Hub, but we will never disable a feature behind a paywall, ever. Our philosophy is "Don't limit users to what they can or can not do, but enable the user to create, inspire, and have a sense of purpose".
